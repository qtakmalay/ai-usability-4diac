## Project Progress & Documentation

**Student:** Azat Vakhitov
**Supervisors:** Prof. Alois Zoitl, Rick Rabiser (JKU Linz, LIT CPS Lab)
**Type:** Seminar + Practicum (combined)

---

## 1. Project Overview

### Goal
Explore to what extent AI agents/LLMs can automate usability assessment tasks for the Eclipse 4diac IDE — a visual programming environment for industrial automation based on the IEC 61499 standard.

### Background
Currently, usability studies at JKU for 4diac IDE require:
- 3+ humans per session (moderator, 2 scribes, 1 participant)
- Remote sessions via Zoom/Skype with screen sharing
- Think-aloud protocols (900+ statements across all subjects)
- Observer notes (370+ observations)
- Semi-structured interviews + questionnaires
- Open coding analysis by researchers

This is expensive, time-consuming, and hard to scale. The research question is: **Can AI replace or augment parts of this process?**

## 4. Research Framework: Cognitive Dimensions of Notations

The paper uses the **Cognitive Dimensions (CD) framework** by Blackwell & Green (2003) — 14 dimensions:

| # | Dimension | What it measures |
|---|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Viscosity | Resistance to change — how many actions for one goal |
| 2 | Visibility | Can you see all relevant info without digging? |
| 3 | Premature Commitment | Forced decisions before having enough info |
| 4 | Hidden Dependencies | Important links between entities not visible |
| 5 | Role-Expressiveness | Can you infer purpose from appearance? |
| 6 | Error-Proneness | Does the interface invite mistakes? |
| 7 | Abstraction | Appropriate abstraction mechanisms? |
| 8 | Secondary Notation | Can you add informal notes/colors? |
| 9 | Closeness of Mapping | Does representation match domain concepts? |
| 10 | Consistency | Similar semantics = similar syntax? |
| 11 | Diffuseness | Is the notation verbose? Large elements? |
| 12 | Hard Mental Operations | High cognitive load tasks? |
| 13 | Provisionality | Can you make tentative changes easily? |
| 14 | Progressive Evaluation | Can you check work-in-progress? |

---

## 5. Ground Truth — Known Usability Issues from Paper

These are the specific issues found by real human evaluators (10 automation engineers in Study 1):

| # | Issue | Frequency | Detected by Gemini? |
|---|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | No search feature for finding instances by name | 6/10 | **YES** — identified as "most crucial improvement" in Task 1 |
| 2 | Difficulty identifying current location in hierarchy | 6/10 | **PARTIAL** — noted breadcrumbs help (newer version has them) |
| 3 | No direct link to all instances of a type | 5/10 | **YES** — "Find all instances of Type X" recommended |
| 4 | Difficulty adding files from filesystem to project | 9/10 | **YES** — noted "subtle folder creation mechanism" |
| 5 | Connection routing criticized | 6/10 | **YES** — mentioned in blind assessment |
| 6 | Confusing context menu names | multiple | **YES** — "Flatten Subapplication" confusion noted |
| 7 | Icons too small / hard to understand | 4/10 | **YES** — "small target area for event pins" |
| 8 | Insufficient input validation | 4/10 | **YES** — "unhelpful error messages" identified as POOR |
| 9 | Cut/paste doesn't maintain cross-hierarchy connections | 5/10 | **NO** — not mentioned (not demonstrated in video) |
| 10 | No visible path from root to current block | 4/10 | **PARTIAL** — noted breadcrumbs exist (v2 feature) |

**Score: ~8/10 issues detected** (6 full, 2 partial, 2 missed)

### Additional Issues Gemini Found (not in paper's top 10 but still valid)
- Broken connections after type change (paper discusses this extensively)
- Repetitive parameter creation workflow
- Lack of visual indicators for direct parameter values
- No batch parameter creation
- Connection creation workflow less efficient than drag-and-drop

---

## 6. Experiments Conducted

**NOTE:** All main experiments (1-3) used **`task_demo.mkv` (TD)** — Bianca's task demo (31MB) — because it shows actual maintenance tasks being performed (the same 4 tasks from the paper). The intro videos (`intro_v1.mkv`, `intro_v2.webm`) are overview presentations, not task executions, so they are less useful for usability assessment comparison with the paper's ground truth.

### Experiment 1: Gemini Video Assessment — Blind Prompt
- **Date:** 2026-03-11
- **Model:** gemini-2.5-flash
- **Input:** `task_demo.mkv` (TD — task demo by Bianca, 31MB)
- **Prompt:** General usability assessment, no framework provided
- **Output:** `exploration/outputs/gemini_video/td_blind.md`
- **Key Findings:**
  - Correctly identified the IDE as a block-based visual programming tool for industrial automation
  - Identified 5 major usability issues and 7 strengths
  - Referenced specific timestamps from the video (e.g., "0:38", "2:19", "5:54")
  - Detected: connection routing, small pins, folder creation issues, context menu confusion, parameter repetitiveness
  - Missed: search feature (not shown in video), cut/paste hierarchy issues

### Experiment 2: Gemini Video Assessment — CD-Guided Prompt
- **Date:** 2026-03-11
- **Model:** gemini-2.5-flash
- **Input:** `task_demo.mkv` (TD)
- **Prompt:** Evaluate using all 14 Cognitive Dimensions
- **Output:** `exploration/outputs/gemini_video/td_cd_guided.md`
- **Key Findings:**
  - Rated each dimension: 4 GOOD, 7 MODERATE, 2 POOR, 1 NOT OBSERVABLE
  - POOR: Error-Proneness (broken connections, unhelpful errors), Hard Mental Operations (re-wiring cognitive load)
  - GOOD: Visibility, Role-Expressiveness, Abstraction, Closeness of Mapping
  - Top 5 critical issues identified align well with paper findings
  - More structured output than blind — easier to compare systematically

### Experiment 3: Gemini Video Assessment — Task-Specific Prompts (4 tasks)
- **Date:** 2026-03-11
- **Model:** gemini-2.5-flash
- **Input:** `task_demo.mkv` (TD)
- **Prompts:** 4 prompts matching the paper's 4 maintenance tasks
- **Outputs:** `exploration/outputs/gemini_video/td_task_task[1-4]_*.md`

**Task 1 (Orientation in Unknown Application):**
- Critical finding: Correctly identified that finding ALL motors requires global search (the paper's #1 issue)
- Praised breadcrumb navigation and "Follow Connection" feature
- Recommended: global search, cross-referencing, contextual Ctrl+F
- **This was the most insightful task-specific assessment**

**Task 2 (Creating/Removing Hierarchies):**
- Correctly assessed grouping/ungrouping as intuitive
- Identified type change connection loss as MAJOR usability issue
- Recommended pin mapping dialog during type changes
- Matched paper's findings on connection handling

**Task 3 (Working with Library):**
- Correctly identified file system interaction issues
- Noted "Change Type" breaking connections as key bottleneck
- Evaluated save/load workflow as logical but improvable
- Matched paper's findings on filesystem difficulties

**Task 4 (Editing):**
- Identified connection creation as "less efficient than ideal" (3-step process vs drag-and-drop)
- Praised type-to-create functionality for function blocks
- Identified parameter addition as efficient with auto-incrementing
- Noted lack of keyboard shortcuts

### Experiment 4: GPT-4o Screenshot Assessment — Blind + CD-Guided
- **Date:** 2026-03-11
- **Model:** gpt-4o
- **Input:** 6 key frames from task_demo.mkv (frames at ~40s, 1:30, 3:10, 5:40, 8:10, 9:50)
- **Outputs:** `exploration/outputs/screenshots/gpt4o_blind.md`, `gpt4o_cd_guided.md`
- **Key Findings:**
  - **Much less detailed than Gemini** — shorter responses, more generic observations
  - Blind: identified 4 issues (clutter, no tooltips, overlapping lines, no context highlighting)
  - CD-guided: rated all 14 dimensions but explanations are shallow and vague
  - **Did NOT identify**: search feature missing, connection breaking on type change, folder creation issues, specific pin/icon problems
  - GPT-4o treats screenshots as static images — misses the interaction flow that Gemini sees from video
  - Suggests features that already exist (zoom/pan, collapsing) — shows it doesn't understand the tool deeply

### Experiment 5: Gemini Screenshot Assessment — Blind + CD-Guided (for comparison)
- **Date:** 2026-03-11
- **Model:** gemini-2.5-flash (same model, screenshots instead of video)
- **Input:** Same 6 frames
- **Outputs:** `exploration/outputs/screenshots/gemini_ss_blind.md`, `gemini_ss_cd_guided.md`
- **Key Findings:**
  - More detailed than GPT-4o but less detailed than Gemini video assessment
  - Still identifies the IDE correctly and provides reasonable observations
  - **Missing the interaction dynamics** — can't see workflows, transitions, error states

### Experiment 6: Increased Frame Density — 20 Frames (every ~33s)
- **Date:** 2026-03-11
- **Models:** GPT-4o + gemini-2.5-flash
- **Input:** 20 frames from task_demo.mkv (extracted every 3s, then every 11th selected)
- **Outputs:** `exploration/outputs/screenshots/gpt4o_blind_20frames.md`, `gemini_ss_blind_20frames.md`
- **Key Findings:**
  - **GPT-4o improved slightly** — now mentions search functionality (missed with 6 frames)
  - Still generic overall, no specific timestamps, suggests features that exist
  - **Gemini with 20 screenshots improved significantly** — references specific frames (0:06, 0:17, etc.), identifies sub-app representation inconsistency, context menu overload, generic parameter naming
  - More frames help both models but the gap remains: video > many screenshots > few screenshots
  - Gemini with 20 screenshots approaches ~5-6/10 ground truth issues (up from ~4/10 with 6 frames)

### Experiment 7: Claude Screenshot Assessment — Blind + CD-Guided (20 frames)
- **Date:** 2026-03-11
- **Model:** claude-sonnet-4
- **Input:** 20 frames from task_demo.mkv
- **Outputs:** `exploration/outputs/screenshots/claude_blind_20frames.md`, `claude_cd_guided_20frames.md`
- **Key Findings:**
  - Claude is **more critical than GPT-4o** — rates more dimensions as POOR (Viscosity, Hidden Deps, Error-Proneness, Secondary Notation, Hard Mental Ops, Provisionality)
  - But **less specific** — doesn't reference specific UI elements or timestamps
  - Blind: mentions search functionality needed, connection complexity, small text/icons
  - CD-guided: 2 GOOD, 4 MODERATE, 6 POOR — harsher than Gemini but without evidence
  - **Claude assumes features don't exist** (e.g., "no visible undo/redo", "no visible shortcuts") when they do exist but weren't shown in screenshots
  - Better than GPT-4o at identifying issues but worse at understanding what the tool actually does

### Experiment 8: Gemini Assessment of Agent Video (AI-observing-AI)
- **Date:** 2026-04-16
- **Model:** gemini-2.5-flash
- **Input:** `agent 121 step sonnet 4-6.mp4` (screen recording of Claude Computer Use interacting with 4diac IDE 3.0.2 at 1024x768, 121 steps, 37.7 MB)
- **Prompts:** Blind + CD-Guided (agent-specific prompts distinguishing IDE issues from agent limitations)
- **Outputs:** `exploration/outputs/agent_video/agent_blind.md`, `agent_cd_guided.md`
- **Novel approach:** AI (Gemini) watching another AI (Claude) use the IDE — meta-analysis
- **Key Findings (Blind):**
  - **Outline vs Palette confusion** rated as major IDE design flaw — agent repeatedly clicked Type Library in Outline expecting to browse contents, but Palette is the actual browser
  - **Component discovery workflow is broken** — no guided transition from defining types to placing instances
  - **Empty canvas with no guidance** — blank grid after project creation
  - **False affordance on library nodes** — look expandable but only select
  - Gemini correctly distinguished IDE issues from agent limitations
  - Praised: project wizard, palette search, FB type editor, Eclipse familiarity
- **Significance:** Validates that Gemini video analysis works on agent interaction recordings, not just human demos — opens the door to automated "observe agent → report issues" pipeline

### Experiment 9: Expert Blinky Build with Paper Practices (4diac IDE 3.0.2)
- **Date:** 2026-04-16
- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.6 via Computer Use API
- **IDE:** 4diac IDE 3.0.2 in Docker (1024x768)
- **Persona:** "Dr. Elena Vogt" — senior IEC 61499 engineer, 12 years experience
- **Task:** Build complete Blinky application (E_CYCLE + E_SWITCH + E_SR) from the official tutorial
- **Paper practices applied:** 10 techniques from 6 papers (persona, CD-guided, trade-off reasoning, few-shot examples, structured format, thinking-first, stop-and-report, F1 matching, keyboard fallbacks, IDE knowledge)
- **Runs:** 3 (30-step test, 38-step failure, **80-step success**)
- **80-step results:**
  - Phase 1 COMPLETE: Created "BlinkTest" project
  - Phase 2 COMPLETE: Placed all 3 FBs (drag-drop failed, used right-click > Insert FB workaround)
  - Phase 3 COMPLETE: Set E_CYCLE DT = T#1s via inline canvas editing
  - Phase 4 STARTED: Attempted connections, blocked by port click precision at step 80
  - **12 usability issues found** with CD dimension annotations and severity ratings
  - **Agent self-corrected** a false observation about auto-population
  - Used structured `[STEP/OBSERVATION/CD/SEVERITY/IDE-vs-AGENT]` format throughout
- **Outputs:** `agent_interaction/outputs/2026-04-16_blinky_expert_80steps_1024x768/`
- **Videos:** `videos/blinky_expert_80steps_2026-04-16.mkv` (screen recording for future Gemini analysis)
- **Gemini assessment: PENDING** — Google API keys revoked due to git commit exposure. New key needed for video upload.

### Video Input Capability Research
- **Gemini:** Native video input via API (best option)
- **GPT-5:** Accepts MP4/MOV natively (released ~Aug 2025), but processes as keyframes internally
- **GPT-4o:** No native video — must extract frames
- **Claude:** No video input — must extract frames. Real-time video API announced for mid-2026 but not yet available
- **Conclusion:** For now, Gemini is the only practical option for true video-based assessment

### Comparison: All Models & Input Types

| Aspect | Gemini (video) | Gemini (20 ss) | Claude (20 ss) | GPT-4o (20 ss) |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Detail level | Very high | High | Moderate | Low-Moderate |
| Specificity | Very specific | Good | Low | Low |
| Issues detected (vs ground truth) | ~8/10 | ~5-6/10 | ~4/10 | ~3-4/10 |
| Domain understanding | Strong | Good | Moderate | Weak |
| Interaction flow | Yes | Partial | No | No |
| Criticality level | Balanced | Balanced | Over-critical | Under-critical |
| Suggests existing features | Rarely | Sometimes | Often | Often |
| CD framework quality | Nuanced, evidence-based | Reasonable | Harsh but vague | Shallow |

**Key takeaways:**
1. **Video input dramatically outperforms screenshots** — regardless of model
2. **Gemini with video is the clear winner** for automated usability assessment
3. **More screenshots help** but can't match video's understanding of interaction flow
4. **Claude is more critical** than GPT-4o but makes more false assumptions about missing features
5. **GPT-4o gives surface-level** observations — least useful for this task

## 7. Conclusions So Far

### What Works
1. **Gemini video processing is remarkably effective** — it correctly identifies the IDE, its components, interaction patterns, and usability issues directly from video
2. **CD-guided prompts produce the most structured, useful output** — easy to systematically compare with ground truth
3. **Task-specific prompts catch domain-specific issues** better (e.g., search feature missing) because they focus attention on what users actually need to do
4. **Blind prompts are good for discovering unexpected issues** that structured prompts might miss
5. **Timestamp references** — Gemini cites specific video timestamps, making results verifiable

### What Doesn't Work (Yet)
1. **Can't detect issues not shown in the video** — e.g., cut/paste across hierarchy wasn't demonstrated
2. **No actual interaction** — Gemini observes but doesn't try to use the IDE itself
3. **Single video limitation** — assessment quality depends on what's shown in the video
4. **No quantitative metrics** — no task completion time, click counts, error rates

### Key Insight
**The CD-guided + task-specific combination is the most effective.** Run CD-guided for the overall structured assessment, then task-specific for deep dives into particular workflows. The blind prompt is good as a sanity check.

### Detection Rate
- **8/10 known issues detected** from a single video (6 full match, 2 partial)
- Several additional valid issues identified that complement the paper's findings
- This suggests AI video assessment could serve as a **cost-effective first pass** before human studies

### Phase 2 Results: Agent Interaction Experiments

**Three rounds of experiments:**

| Round | Date | Platform | Resolution | Steps | Tasks | Issues |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|-------|-------|--------|
| macOS (QEMU) | 2026-03-11 | ARM Mac | 1920x1080 | 30 | T1 only | 3+3 QEMU |
| Windows (native) | 2026-03-23 | x86_64 | 1920x1080 | 120 | All 4 | **12 genuine** |
| Windows (fixed) | 2026-04-16 | x86_64 | **1024x768** | **121** | T1 | **15 deep issues** |

**April 16 BREAKTHROUGH (121-step unlimited run):**
The agent achieved dramatically more than any previous run:
- **Created "MotorControlSystem" project** from scratch via File > New
- **Created "MotorControl" Basic FB type** via File > New > Type
- Explored Standard Libraries palette, searched for "motor"
- Navigated System Explorer, Type Navigator, breadcrumb navigation
- Attempted palette drag-and-drop FB placement (failed silently)
- Found 15 usability issues at the actual IDE workflow level (not just Welcome screen)
- Terminated at step 121 due to API credit exhaustion

**Key issues found (April 16):**
1. Breadcrumb navigation doesn't change view (Critical)
2. No visual distinction between system/application level (Critical)
3. Palette drag-and-drop to canvas fails silently (Major)
4. Right-click on empty canvas produces no context menu (Critical)
5. System Explorer doesn't auto-refresh for newly created types (Major)
6. "Select Example:" list completely empty (Major)

**Output files (reorganized):**
- `agent_interaction/outputs/2026-03-23_all-tasks_30steps_1920x1080/` — March Windows run
- `agent_interaction/outputs/2026-04-16_task1_30steps_1024x768/` — April 30-step run
- `agent_interaction/outputs/2026-04-16_task1_121steps_1024x768/` — April BREAKTHROUGH run
- `agent_interaction/outputs/logs/` — Terminal session logs

### Short-term

## 9. Tips & Notes

### Technical Tips
- **Google GenAI SDK:** Use `google-genai` (new), NOT `google-generativeai` (deprecated)
- **Model naming:** `gemini-2.0-flash` is retired for new users. Use `gemini-2.5-flash` or newer
- **Video upload:** Gemini requires uploading video first, then waiting for PROCESSING→ACTIVE state (takes ~20-30s)
- **Rate limits:** Add 5s pause between consecutive Gemini API calls
- **Conda env:** Always use `4diac` env for this project to isolate dependencies
- **Video format:** yt-dlp downloads as .mkv or .webm — Gemini handles both fine

### Research Tips
- **Document EVERYTHING** — prompts, model versions, timestamps, outputs.
- **Keep prompts fixed** when comparing models — only change one variable at a time
- **The paper's study materials are on Zenodo** (DOI: 10.5281/ZENODO.4758816) — includes protocols, questionnaire, task list, interview questions
- **Cross-reference with the paper's specific findings** — Table 2 (strengths/weaknesses), Figures 7-10 (questionnaire results)

### Project Management
- Report due after the final presentation
- Keep this progress.md updated as the single source of truth
- Use memory system (Claude/agents) to track experiment state across sessions
